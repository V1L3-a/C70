            <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize"></h5>

            <p class="text-success text-left">It's the last day of school and Oswald is being taken to school by his dad before work. Oswald decides to draw, he had been drawing mechanical animals lately for some reason and imagines them to be human-size and a bit creepy too.

Oswald is taken to the library by his dad every day in his summer to spend his time while he's at work as they had no money to spend on anything frivolous due to his dad losing his job at the recently closed mill. He would have spent his time with Ben, his best friend, if he hadn't moved out from town due to his father's new job. Oswald eventually starts spending his days between playing games reading books, and grabbing a cheap lunch at the nearby Jeff's Pizza. Jeff's was creepy and weird, as described by Ben. It has a big empty space, a stage that he had never seen anyone use, and a dirty ball pit that's a constant reminder of the reality of pink eye. Jeff, ever miserable-looking, is the only worker in the place.

After having the same routine for a few days. He'd had an argument with his dad before going back to the library one day. Before his dad picks him up at Jeff's Pizza, Oswald decides to punish his dad by hiding in the ball pit at Jeff's until his dad could find him.

After spending what seemed an abnormal about of time in the ball pit, Oswald emerges to find himself in a completely different place. The room is filled with children and arcade machines and is way brighter and more colorful than Jeff's miserable pizza place. He also sees three animatronics standing on the stage: a bear, a rabbit, and a bird. He finds them similar to the drawings he made before, but definitely on the creepier end of the scale. He also finds on a calendar with the year 1985. He bumps into two kids, Chip and Mike. After playing a few games with them, Oswald starts to worry about how to go back to his world. To do so, he would simply dive back into the ball pit and pop back out in Jeff's.

Over the next few weeks, Oswald goes into the pit to play with Chip and Mike, doing his best to keep up with conversations relevant to 1985 and trying hard not to talk about anything from the future. Sometimes he would see a man in a yellow rabbit costume watching him from afar, finding it weird that no one else seems to pay the rabbit any mind. However, one day, he comes out of the ball pit to hear screaming, frantic running, and crying. He sees the rabbit beckoning him to a back room and he follows out of curiosity, thinking he can't be harmed in a time before he was even born. There, he sees six dead kids, each wearing party hats. Oswald runs to the ball pit as fast he can to get back to the present day.

Once outside of the ball pit, he sees Jeff and his dad who are mad at him for hiding in the off-limits ball pit. As they're about to leave, the bunny appears, pulling Oswald's dad into the pit. After a cartoonish fight in the ball pit, the bunny emerges from the pit and takes Oswald to his dad's car. Jeff seems to make no notice of the rabbit. Once home, Oswald frantically texts his mom for help, but when she gets home, she is confused as everything is normal. Turns out, everyone sees the bunny as Oswald's dad except for Oswald. And his cat.

After figuring out that he's the only one who can see the rabbit for who he is, he spends the next several days pretending the rabbit is really his father, biding his time to make an escape.

A few days later, Oswald gets his chance and sneaks out of the house to investigate the ball pit more. He finds his dad unconscious, but alive, inside of it. As he tries to get him out, the bunny attacks, revealing itself as an organic creature and unhinging its jaw to bite Oswald, drawing blood. Oswald manages to cause the bunny to accidentally hang itself on a rope over the ball pit, killing it. Oswald and his dad, who has no memory of the event, go home, with everything ending on a relatively normal note.</p>

            <hr>

            <p class="text-success text-left">Sarah wants to be beautiful. She wishes this because she thinks she is hideous and thus invisible to the boy she likes. One day, she tries to make herself noticed by the popular girls by sitting at their table, but just ends up upset when they don't notice her, and spills a salad on her crush by accident.

Later that day, walking home from school, she sees what looks like an arm coming out of the trunk of a car in a junkyard. Curious, she opens the trunk, to find Eleanor. She takes the animatronic home, cleans it up, and then turns it on. The robot springs to life and introduces herself as Eleanor. To show her appreciation for cleaning her up and turning her on, Eleanor promises to grant any wish Sarah may have, to which Sarah requests to become beautiful. Upon hearing the wish, Eleanor tells Sarah to give her time to think how to do it.

The next day when Sarah gets home from school Eleanor gives her a heart shaped pendant, and instructs her to never under any circumstance take the pendant off. Eleanor then instructs Sarah to get in bed so that she can sing her to sleep, which is the only way for her to help make Sarah beautiful.

When Sarah wakes up the next day, she sees that her arms have changed, and when she goes to school she gets a compliment from one of the popular girls about how her nails look. When she gets home, Eleanor again instructs her to get in bed, and when she gets up she is again changed. This continues until all that is left of Sarah before she met Eleanor is her face. when she asks Eleanor to change this, Eleanor warns that she may not recognize her own face. When Sarah still insists, Eleanor instructs her to once again go to sleep.

Sarah wakes up with a new, perfect face, and goes to school. She becomes friends with the popular kids and gets a date with her crush. She spends an entire weekend with her new friends and her life is going really well. One night before school, she has a nightmare about Eleanor, and wakes up to find her standing over her bed. She tells Eleanor to go to the corner, which Eleanor does.

That day, during lunch, Sarah trips and falls, causing the pendant to come off. She starts shaking uncontrollably and also hears screams coming from other kids. She realizes she is no longer human but scrapyard junk pieced together. She runs home in panic, but can not find Eleanor anywhere. Finally, she looks in the basement and finds garbage bags filled with human parts, which she realizes are her own.

It turns out Eleanor was preforming surgery on Sarah every night, removing her own body parts and replacing them with junk. Eleanor appears, wearing a necklace similar to Sarah's. She presses a button on it, and transforms into Sarah pre-surgery, where Sarah realizes she hadn't been bad looking at all, Eleanor runs off. Sarah is left alone as a bunch of junk, not being able to feel anything.</p>

            <p class="text-success text-left">Millie is a goth girl who recently moved in with her grandfather. At school, Millie doesn't have many friends and spends time by herself reading and writing poems about death. One day at school, a new goth kid named Dylan sat next to her at the table. They bond over a shared love of horror stories. She starts thinking about love instead of death, and reads and writes poems about it. Later, they go to a library together, where she realizes her crush on him.

At the school's Christmas party, Millie finds Dylan kissing another girl. She goes home angry and depressed. The next day, she asks why Dylan cheated on her, but he responds that he never had feelings for her, and that he just wanted to be friends. Dylan accuses her of being hypocritical and ends their friendship.

At her grandfather's Christmas party, all of Millie's uncles, aunts, and cousins come to her house to celebrate. She finds the party nauseating and tries to find a place to hide from them. She explores her grandfather's workshop until she sees the deactivated Funtime Freddy. She climbs inside its body cavity.

This leads to the opening scene of the story, where Millie wakes up to see Funtime Freddy's eyes looking down at her. Funtime Freddy tells her that he's going to kill her, but she gets to choose how she'll die. He jokes about Millie's obsession with death, and how he is going to grant her wish. Millie begs to get out, but Funtime Freddy refuses.

Funtime Freddy gives Millie seven options to die: starvation/dehydration, hypothermia, impalement, electrocution, boiling, and decapitation. He describes each method with great detail and enjoyment. Millie agrees to decapitation, believing that she can curl herself small enough to dodge the blade. Funtime Freddy then gives an execution speech, talking about how Millie has been a criminal against humanity through the way she acted towards other people. Millie decides to make it a point to be kinder to the people around her if she survives. The blade then slices through the cavity. It's never revealed whether she survived or not.

At the end of the story, her grandfather waits for Millie to come back so that she can have all her presents.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Oswald is a fifth-grader who lives in a very small town. He studies at a school called Westbrook Elementary. His family is now tight on money as his dad recently lost his job due to the local mill closing and currently has a part-time job at Snack Space. However, his mom's job at the hospital is able to keep the family running. He has a close friend named Ben who moved away due to his dad getting a new job after the closing of the aforementioned mill.

He seems to like his mom more than his dad as he was always annoyed at how out-of-date he is and would sometimes argue with him.

He likes to draw, with recent subjects being ambiguously creepy anthropomorphized animals that were furry on the outside but robotic on the inside. He has a preference science-fiction, using his days at the library to read a series in the genre and an unidentified manga as well as playing on online fantasy game. He enjoys the old Zendrelix movies (likely a parody of old Godzilla movies), ironic given his dislike of his dad's outdated tastes.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Spring Bonnie is a bulky, animatronic golden rabbit with a large head, not too different from Nightmare Fredbear's, with square teeth in his wide mouth. In the cover, his eyes are small and blue, with apparent flesh surrounding them and a black oily looking liquid oozes from his left eye, while his eyes are blank in the unused illustration, with no black tears. His body is rotund, yet no larger than his head, with slightly thinner limbs attached to them. The book describes him as looking organic, with an unhinging jaw and two rows of sharp fangs.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Sarah has frizzy brown hair, blue eyes, and Caucasian skin. She describes herself as being flat and fat. She likes to wear makeup to make herself more beautiful.

After the makeover from Eleanor, Sarah becomes a lot more attractive. Her arms and legs become slimmer, and she becomes taller. Her hair and nose become straighter, and her eyes become wider and deeper. She is told by Eleanor to always wear a special necklace, and she wears fancier clothes to accentuate her new body.

When the necklace falls off, Sarah's body slowly reveals itself to be a scrap metal endoskeleton. As parts of her new "body" falls off, she eventually turns into a pile of scrap metal.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Eleanor is said to have a painted face, with pink cheeks and lips. Her red hair is tied into two tight pigtails, and her eyes are a bright green with long lashes. Her body is sleek and silver, with a long neck, tiny waist, and a rounded bust and hips. Her arms and legs are long and skinny. Her body is also small.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Millie is a female teenager with long, black hair, as seen in the teaser image. She is known to most people as a 'goth' and wears dark clothing. She mentions that she lightens her skin and she wears burial jewelry. Due to her dark appearance, she garners a lot of negative attention, to the point where she's called Dracula's Daughter in a mocking way.

Millie also has a black cat named Annabel Lee, named for the Edger Allan Poe poem.

Millie is a typical "goth" teenager. She obsesses over death to the point where she constantly reads and writes poems about it. She even romanticizes death as an anthropomorphized, attractive man - specifically Curt Carrion, her favorite singer.</p>

His suit itself is described as withering, its white and pink color fading off into a dingy gray. He wears a top hat and bowtie, his limbs unhinged.</p>
